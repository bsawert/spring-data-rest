#Example Backbone.js App with Spring Data REST

This is a bare bones application that integrates a Spring Data REST repository on the back end with a minimal Backbone.js front end. It demonstrates the changes needed for Backbone to parse the Spring Data REST JSON, and for Spring to send the entity ID that Backbone requires.

The front end was adapted from David Morrow's excellent minimalist Backbone app. You can see his original at <https://github.com/dperrymorrow/example-backbone-app>.
